    <h2>Narrative</h2>
    <p>Ever since I can remember, I have always enjoyed taking things apart and putting them back together. Guided by my
        childhood mentor, my father, I am on a path to excel in a field that not only aligns with my comfort but also
        brings me immense satisfaction. To achieve my
        goal of pursuing Computer Science, I am currently taking Python classes to excel in my knowledge, so that
        I can get farther in my career. As the end of freshman year nears, the experience I have gained from taking the
        Computer Science Essentials is amazing. Students can get exposure to coding their websites,
        programs, and machines in different coding languages. My coursework not only sharpens my analytical and
        problem-solving skills but also fuels my curiosity to explore new technologies and their applications.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        As I progress throughout high school, I want to aim to involve myself in as many Engineering and Computer Science
        opportunities as I can. By further extending my knowledge into this pathway, I will be able to contribute more
        to future projects I am involved in. Looking ahead, I aspire to pursue Computer Science at a prestigious
        institution like MIT and envision myself innovating programs that can change the world. Additionally, one
        highlight from my engineering-related experiences is the Entrepreneurship Project. This project allowed groups
        of students to
        connect all of the topics we learned throughout the year and make it into one big project. It was exciting to
        create and had some
        laughs while making it.
