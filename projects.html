        This project aimed to replicate a restaurant setting that allows the user to order food. As this project was an
        individual effort, I wanted to make a simpler and more efficient program than the last iteration I made a few
        months
        back. Features of this project include: allowing the user to order multiple of the same food item, allowing the
        user
        to add and remove food from their order, allowing the user to start a new order, and it’s unbreakable. While
        making
        this project, I had to document on GitHub as well. The documentation goes into depth and highlights the key
        parts of
        the project. As I worked on this project, I discovered that using functions can streamline your code
        effectively.
        Functions come with parameters, which allow you to execute specific code when the function is called.
        Additionally,
        I also learned how to use “try:” and “except:” statements to make my code unbreakable. These statements enable
        you
        to identify potential errors in the code and manage them efficiently.

        <h2>Pacman Game</h2>

        This project aimed to make a creative app/game that a user can play. My partner and I decided that we would
        design a
        PacMan game with our ideas and touches to make it more unique. This app had the design of a normal PacMan Game,
        but
        we coded it so that there were secret levels when you clicked on the ghosts or hidden buttons on the screen. My
        contribution to this project was coding the home page, secret levels, and testing the program several times to
        ensure it was working efficiently. While making the project, we documented the process of the creation of the
        project. The documentation details each sprint/iteration we did and the code for the entire program. We also
        included pictures and videos of the app running. Throughout the process of the project, I became proficient in
        using
        global and local variables in block coding on MIT App Inventor. This taught me what type of variable I had to
        use in
        different parts of the program. Global variables can be accessed in every part of the program, while local
        variables
        are only accessible in one part of the program. However, only using one or the other can complicate the program
        and
        make it messy. Additionally, this project also allowed me to gain experience in designing a user interface that
        is
        easy to operate and simple. Being able to design a simple and efficient user interface is critical to appealing
        to
        the user and the overall appearance of your program.
